# Oceanet Cloud service

## ⚠ This is a <em>portfolio piece</em>, not a commercial service. ⚠

Oceanet is a simulated cloud platform inspired by AWS, Azure, and Vercel, where user can upload, store data, and deploy app services from a single dashboard. This project intent for demostrate and practice full-stack web engineering capability, not a production service.

## Overview

Oceanet is my keystone portfolio project. I'm treating it like a full SaaS product, to demonstrate how I approach:

- Complex feature planning
- Backend development
- Frontend architecture
- Real-world system constraints

By the end, it will be able to:

- Let users sign up and create a workspace
- Upload and manage static files
- Share the workspace with other account (maybe with access permission)
- Manage apps and deployments from a dashboard

## Status
